                                             Docker is a containized engine(Hub.Docker username : rakeshreddy261)

We have  two type of Application Software 

1) Application Software 
2) System software 


Basically the application softeware We use for example like  (zoom sky )etc

This application s/w is underline OS like( windows and linux)etc

Those underline OS we called as system software

Those system software is talk to Hardware (H/W) is having (CPU memory Disk)

Note : The Application s/w directly doesn't  talk to hardware directly is taking help of System software


By using this legacy we are facing the problem

For example : SQL S/w application  is underling windows (W) operating system in server 1

And oracle S/w application is underling linux (L)operating system in server 2

So this prolem solving we have using hyperview 

>Hyperview having only one server in that server top up we having  hyperview And w having underline servers there we can  moving the data

here also we having facing the issue here for example oracle and mssql is EE edition s/w when we there run we have windows and linux OS so we maintance both software licenses
So those problem rectified we are using virtualization by using this virtualization we rectified this problem 

We having virtualization in that to up  guest OS and Docker host in that using the Applications  SQL and  orcal so we that  can easily migration to anothere application 


>Git bash is  interface is connect to Linux server that  located in a cloud service
