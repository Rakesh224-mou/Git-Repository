**********************Git***********

*Version control system(VSC)
We have two type they are in below

1> Centrolized repository 
2> Distribute repository

*git comes under Distribute repository

By using git we can push the code into Local repositry 

VCS having a capability 

1> **code repository
2>**persistence older and new data we can jump into older vesion data and new version data
3)**VCS also having special capability that is continues traking who make change the code and what time

In git git --global user-name " Rakesh"
        git --global user-mail "rakesh.singireddy1996@gmail.com"

* First we create a new folder and push some file code into the folder then
that folder initialized into git repository by using git command

>git init
Then we can use git commands

>git status

show all files in untracked file and stagging files

when we push the code into LR we have 3 state 

1) untracked file
2) stagging file
3) local repository

*We called working directory called as untracked files
*buffere stagging called as index file
* Local repository is called as commited files

>git add file name

that file goes to stagging area that fille goes to commited state

>git commit -m "message"

that file goes to local repository
